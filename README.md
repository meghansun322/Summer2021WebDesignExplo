# Summer 2021 Web Design Exploration Project
In the Summer 2021, I have been determined to develop a fundamental understanding of Web Design by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online tutorials, reading about Web Design languages and practices, and creating many projects. I have spent 40+ immersing myself in the Web Design field with the end goal of creating my personal website by the end of the Summer 2021. 

In this tutorial specfically, I learned about and used custom style properties, grid display, flex box, media queries, and JavaScript to create an interactive portfolio. The implementation of the navigation bar with the hamburger icon was a new features I was introduced with and the most challenging aspect, as the 'click' from JavaScript and position of the icons took some time to get familirized with.
